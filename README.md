- 👋 Hi, I’m @liuxiangchong(刘向冲) working at the Institute of Geomechanics, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences.
- 👀 I’m interested in numerical modeling of hydrothermal ore forming processes and statistical analysis of geochemical data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to model fluid-rock interactions under hydrothermal conditions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on numerical modeling of ore deposits and analyzing and interpreting geochemical exploration data and other compositional data
- 📫 My email is xcliu@cags.ac.cn and liuxiangchong1987@163.com.
