This is the Matlab file used to do princile component analysis of compositional data in Liu et al., (2020,JGE). The users will get two bi-plots of the first four components and their scores after two steps:
1. prepare two texts, one is elements.txt and the other is contents.txt
   elements.txt contains the names of the elements or variables, and contents.txt contains the concentration data. 
2. run the program pca_ilr_in_clr.m.

Four notes:
1. the number of elements must be consistent with the column number of content data;
2. the first column of contents.txt is the content data of the first element in elements.txt;
3. the content data cannot have missing values, i.e. the data should be a matrix of n*m;
4. the first bi-plot is the first vs the second components, the second bi-plot for the third vs the fourth components
